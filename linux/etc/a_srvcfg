#  determine which address to use when listening for connections.  The
#  default value is blank, which will use the first address found.
#SERVER_IP

#  If you have multiple Network Interface Cards in your server, and each
#  card is associated with a different host name, then this variable can
#  be used to determine which name to use when listening for connections.
#  This is only used if SERVER_IP (above) is not used.
#  The default value is blank, which means to use the standard hostname.

#  is all blanks.  The default is 0.
