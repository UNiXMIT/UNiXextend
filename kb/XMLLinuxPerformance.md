# Very slow performance of XML EXPORT FILE on Linux
## Problem
When using XML EXTENSIONS, the statement XML EXPORT FILE using an XSLT stylesheet takes a few seconds on Windows but on Linux it takes between 2 and 4 minutes.  

## Resolution
The issue is with the 3rd party stylesheet processor library. On Windows, Microsoftâ€™s stylesheet processor performs a lot better. There isn't anything that can be done to improve performance on Linux until the 3rd party library is fixed by its authors.
