# New Activator Wizard README
If you are activating licenses generated and issued by Micro Focus after January 2021, please download and use the NEW activator.  

If you are activating old licenses, issued prior to January 2021, you can continue to use the original Activator that is installed with the product. The 'activator.exe' can be found in the 'bin' directory of the AcuCOBOL installation.  

From 10.4.0 onwards, the activator that is installed with the product can be used to activate licenses.
