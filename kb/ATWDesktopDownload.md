# Is there a permanent link for the AcuToWeb Desktop download?
## Environment
AcuToWeb  
Windows  
Linux/UNIX  

## Situation
Please could you let me know if itâ€™s possible to have a permanent link to allow the AcuToWeb desktop to be downloaded? I would like to include the link on a website so that the users can download it as required. I have just tried the one below and it is no longer valid.  

## Resolution
Starting in 10.5.0 there is a permanent link to allow users to download AcuToWeb Desktop from an AcuToWeb server instance.  
The URL will differ depending on the domain/port where ATW is hosted but the URI will be the same.  

```
http://example.com/desktop/download
```

This link will download the AcuToWeb_Desktop_Setup.msi installer.  
In 10.5.0 there is also a AcuToWeb Desktop Auto-update feature that may also be useful and will make it easier for the end-user to update ATW Desktop to the latest version.  
Details on this new feature can be found in the documentation at:
