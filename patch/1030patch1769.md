## Linux Workaround  

There appears to be a small issue with the latest patch on Linux. It can be worked around by following these steps:  

1.	Change directory to the acutoweb directory of the 10.3.0 patch installation.  

2.	Open the acutoweb-gateway script in a text editor. 

4.  On line 17 change the line from:

```
Python2.7/python -OO Gateway/main.py ${CONFIG} > gateway.out 2>&1 &
```

to

```
Python2.7/bin/python -OO Gateway/main.py ${CONFIG} > gateway.out 2>&1 &
```

3.	Save the script and start AcuToWeb as normal.
